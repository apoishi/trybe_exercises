## Exercises

1. The factorial is the multiplication of a natural number by its predecessors, except zero. For example:
The factorial is represented by the sign !
4! = 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24
Based on this information, create an algorithm that returns the factorial of 10.

2. Develop an algorithm that is able to invert a word. For example, the word "banana" would be inverted to "ananab".

3. Consider the array of strings below:
let array = ['java', 'javascript', 'python', 'html', 'css'];
Write two algorithms: one that returns the largest word in this array and one that returns the smallest. Consider the number of characters in each word.

4. A prime number is one that is divisible only by 1 and itself. Knowing this, write an algorithm that returns the largest prime number between 0 and 50.

## Bonus

1. Now let's work with some geometric shapes! Write a program that, given any value n, be n > 1 , prints on the screen a square made of asterisks with sides of size n . For example:

n = 5

\*\*\*\*\*\
\*\*\*\*\*\
\*\*\*\*\*\
\*\*\*\*\*\
\*\*\*\*\*

2. For the second exercise, do the same as the previous one, but print a right triangle with 5 base asterisks. For example:

n = 5

\*\
\*\*\
\*\*\*\
\*\*\*\*\
\*\*\*\*\*

3. Now invert the side of the triangle. For example:

n = 5

        \*\
      \*\*\
    \*\*\*\
  \*\*\*\*\
\*\*\*\*\*

Attention! Note that this exercise is much more complex than the previous one! It is not enough here to print only asterisks. You will need logic to print spaces as well.

4. Then make a pyramid with n base asterisks:

n = 5

    \*\
  \*\*\*\
\*\*\*\*\*

5. Make a pyramid with n base asterisks that is empty in the middle. Assume that the value of n will always be odd. Finally, let's make the variable increment with the value corresponding to each loop;

n = 7

     \*\
   \*   \*\
 \*       \*\
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

6. Write a program that tells if a number defined in a variable is prime or not.
A prime number is a number that is only divisible by 1 and itself, that is, dividing it with any other numbers gives a non-zero remainder.
Hint: you will need to loop from 0 to the defined number; Also, you will need to do a check every iteration and store the results somewhere.
