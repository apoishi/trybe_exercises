# Exercises

## Exercise - 01

To do the exercise, read the statement carefully. After understanding what was asked, develop the solution and then check if you were able to fulfill it.

1. To perform this exercise, copy the HTML code to a file index.html. Then implement the CSS properties and, if necessary, make additions to the existing HTML structure, so that the final result is similar to the reference image.
Remember that the page structure must be maintained so that the semantics of the code are preserved.

## Exercise - 02

The purpose of these exercises is to put into practice what you have just learned about semantic HTML.
For that, we will create a page that presents one of the most impressive animals that exist: the Stomatopoda. The styling of the page is up to you. ðŸ˜‰

For better organization, make commits for each completed task. Let's get to the exercises:

1. Add a header on the page containing the title Punch at 80km/h: Meet the Stomatopoda.
2. Add a set of links that represent the navigation area of â€‹â€‹the site.
* Create a link called Home.
* Create a link called About.
* Create a link called Contact.
3. Create an article that will contain interesting facts about Stomatopoda. The article will be subtitled Stomatopoda Facts. Here's an animal site for inspiration to get facts.
4. Divide the article into sections, organizing it as follows:
* A first section containing general information about the animal. The subtitle for this section is up to you. Its scientific name must be included in this section, which is Odontodactylus scyllarus, in italics. * In addition, there must be tabular information about its scientific classification, specifically: Kingdom , Phylum , Subphylum , Class , Subclass and Order . Such information can be obtained from Wikipedia.
* The other sections concern the interesting facts you have chosen about the animal. For each fact chosen you will create a section.
* Add, for each section, a subtitle referring to the chosen fact.
* Add, for each section, paragraph(s) describing the chosen fact. Highlight impressive features regarding the suit you have chosen, in order to reinforce the uniqueness of Stomatopoda. For example, if you create a section detailing the animal's powerful punch, it would be interesting to highlight the speed of that punch (80km/h) in bold.
* Add, for each section, an image, as a way of illustrating the fact.
* Finally, add a bibliography section, containing a list of all the links that were used as a basis for compiling the page in question.
5. Add adjacent content to the article, providing a link to this video, which shows the animal in action.
6. Add a footer to the page, showing something like this:

* "Content compiled by <insert your name>, <current year>".
Note: for this exercise, it is mandatory to use at least 6 elements with the following tags: header , nav , article , section , h1 , h2 , h3, aside , footer , table and img .
