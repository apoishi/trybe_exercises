##Exercises

The purpose of these exercises is to put into practice what you have just learned about DOM. Therefore, you must do the exercises using only JavaScript code, which must be inserted between the <script> and </script> tags.

ğŸš€ Add the h1 tag with the text Exercise 5.2 - JavaScript DOM as a child of the body tag;
ğŸš€ Add the main tag with the main-content class as a child of the body tag;
ğŸš€ Add the section tag with the center-content class as a child of the main tag created in step 2;
ğŸš€ Add the p tag as a child of the section created in step 3 and put some text;
ğŸš€ Add the section tag with the left-content class as a child of the main tag created in step 2;
ğŸš€ Add the section tag with the right-content class as a child of the main tag created in step 2;
ğŸš€ Add an image with src set to the value https://picsum.photos/200 and class small-image. This element must be a child of the section created in step 5;
ğŸš€ Add an unordered list with the values â€‹â€‹from 1 to 10 in full, i.e. one, two, three, ... as list values. This list must be a child of the section created in step 6;
ğŸš€ Add 3 h3 tags, all children of the main created in step 2.
Now that you've created a lot, let's make some changes and removals:
ğŸš€ Add the title class to the created h1 tag;
ğŸš€ Add the description class to the 3 created h3 tags;
ğŸš€ Remove the section created in step 5 (the one with the left-content class). Use the .removeChild() function;
ğŸš€ Center the section created in step 6 (the one with the right-content class). Tip: to center, just set the margin-right: auto da section;
ğŸš€ Change the background color of the parent element of the section created in step 3 (the one with the center-content class) to green;
ğŸš€ Remove the last two elements (nine and ten) from the list created in step 8.
