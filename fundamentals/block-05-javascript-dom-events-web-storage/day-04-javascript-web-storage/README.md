## Exercises

Imagine that you are the person responsible for developing a page that will serve as a reader for written content.
This written content could be a book page, a magazine report, or an online newspaper note. So that you don't have to think about the content of the page, use this [link](https://www.lipsum.com/) to generate the text for your page.
So far, nothing new, but this demand requires you to apply reader preferences on the page to improve their reading experience.
People must have the power to change:
Screen background color;
Text color;
Font size;
Spacing between lines of text;
Font type (Font family).
These preferences must be saved so that, when returning to the page, the preferences that were previously set can be applied to the screen.
