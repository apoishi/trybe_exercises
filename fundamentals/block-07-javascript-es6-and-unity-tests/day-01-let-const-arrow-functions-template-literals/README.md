## Exercises

### Part I
ðŸš€ 1. Make the necessary modifications to the function so that its behavior respects the scope in which each variable was declared.
* Modify the function structure so that it is an arrow function.
* Change the concatenations for template literals.

ðŸš€ 2. Make a function that returns the oddsAndEvens array in ascending order.
* Use template literals so that the call console.log(<your code>oddsAndEvens<your code>); return "The numbers 2,3,4,7,10,13 are in ascending order!".
* Bonus (optional): try doing the same exercise using the array.sort() method. Spoiler: It is possible to perform a function that sorts any array of numbers.

### Part II
1. Create a function that takes a number and returns its factorial.
In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative number N, with the notation N!, is the product of all integers less than or equal to N. Example: 4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24.
* Bonus (optional): Try doing the same exercise recursively. Spoiler: It is possible to resolve with one line using ternary operator.

2. Create a function that takes a phrase and returns the longest word.

ðŸš€ 3. Create a page that contains:
A button to which an event listener will be associated;
A clickCount variable in the JavaScript file that accumulates the number of clicks on the button;
A field in the HTML that updates the number of clicks on the button as the clickCount variable is updated.
